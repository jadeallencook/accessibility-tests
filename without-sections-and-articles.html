      <h1>Learn More About Accessibility</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website about accessibility. Accessibility is the practice
        of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Accessibility Is Important</h2>
      <p>
        The internet is an increasingly important resource in many areas of
        life, including education, employment, commerce, government, recreation,
        and more. It is essential that the web be accessible in order to provide
        equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities.
